        Do you have enough money? Do you have everything you've been dreaming
        of? Are you happy with how your life is going? If the answer is 'Yes',
        then just don't waste your time and close this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who answered 'No', go on reading. I'll tell you how to quit your
        annoying full time job and start earning
        <span class="bold">₦133,370</span> or
        <span class="bold">₦166,713</span> a day in just 2 days, from the
        comfort of your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I succeeded in it, and if you want, you'll be successful, too! It won't
        hurt me if I share this secret with you, while it will help some of you
        to change your life for good and finally become financially free.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, a couple of words about myself. My name is Destiny Akuffo. I'm
        26, I live in Lagos, and I'm just an ordinary girl from a family, which
        cannot by any means be called 'well-off'. I was born to middle-aged
        parents. My Mum was a nurse at clinic, while my Dad was a dump truck
        driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was little, all I remember was that my parents made every effort
        to buy the cheapest food and clothes possible. If they were lucky
        enough, they would save up a bit for vacation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I graduated from secondary school, I didn't even think about going
        to university, as I needed to raise money for my parents (already
        retired) and myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I found a job instead, worked as a sales assistant, with a monthly
        salary around <span class="bold">₦133,370</span>. It was 2014, and this
        was quite a good starting salary for Nigeria.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made enough money for living, but I had a dream, which was to buy a
        brand new Porsche Panamera. I knew it was extemely expensive and I'd
        have to save up for years. However, this was fine with me. After all, it
        was a dream, and you just can't make your dream come true in a day or
        two. Well, this is what I thought at the time...
      </p>
      <p>
        I was really depressed at my financial situation then, prices were
        starting to increase due to inflation and living in Nigeria became more
        difficult. People were upset but I knew I had to carry on working...
      </p>
      <p>
        However, 3 months more passed, and the shop I worked at turned bankrupt,
        so here I was, with no job or income sources at all, having to live on
        my parents' retirement benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        These were actually joyless times. I was looking desperately for any
        possible job opportunity on the Internet, but after nearly two months,
        there were no results at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another two weeks passed, and I was about to abandon all hope, when
        suddenly I came across a web page. This was a story about a guy who had
        earned <span class="bold">₦3,334,268</span> on the net, in front of his
        computer, without even leaving the house he lived in!
      </p>
      <p>
        He said he had traded via
        <a href="https://pocketoption.com/smart/u5Wf6vpsXFCdX6" class="blue"
          >Pocket Option</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt dizzy. Could it be the opportunity I'd been looking for, the one
        that comes up <span class="bold">once in a lifetime ?</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, I hardly understood anything, but I went on reasearching more
        info, websites, forums, blogs, and other sources on this topic, and,
        eventually, I became quite knowledgeable in it. I felt so happy that I
        even remember this now. It was so exciting to think I became an expert
        and could now start earning cash online...
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's put my story aside for a bit, as I also want you to know what
        I'm talking about. I'm going to tell you what trading, in a nutshell, so
        that you don't have to research dozens of websites, just like I did.
        I'll just save you a lot of time and effort.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Trading is a revolutionary way of earning in the financial markets,
        which is very straightforward, quick, and extremely lucrative. You
        probably know what financial markets are venues where currencies, such
        as the dollar, the euro, or the pound, are are traded 24/7, i.e. with no
        breaks or days off whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        What you need to do is just open a free account on a trading platform (a
        broker website), then make a deposit, select an investment amount and
        predict where the price (for example, the US dollar exchange rate) will
        go in a few minutes or hours.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        There are only two options available: High or Low. The trade may last
        for any time from 1 minute to 3 hours (the expiry time), and you may
        select any time frame in between. If your prediction is correct, your
        investment amount is nearly doubled; if it is wrong, well, you just lose
        your investment amount.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        So, this will actually be your job if you follow my instructions. This
        is called 'trading', and a person who works in such a way is called a
        'trader'. As a trader, you can work any time wherever you are, all you
        need is a computer with stable internet connection. As you see, it's
        pretty straight forward, even a 10-year-old would understand how it
        works!
      </p>
      <p>
        When I finally became fully knowledgeable about the process, I got so
        excited that I knew I needed to try it out
        <span class="bold">right away.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I signed up for a free account at
        <a href="https://pocketoption.com/smart/u5Wf6vpsXFCdX6" class="blue"
          >Pocket Option</a
        >
        , the same broker that the guy wrote his story about. Later, I learnt
        this was indeed one of the best trading platforms on the net.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I opened my account, I got $10,000 in demo credits, very handy for
        testing and practising. This is also absolutely free for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I started trading with these virtual credits, and just in a single
        hour I made a 11,000 profit! Of course, these were just demo credits,
        while I was hunting for real cash. Well, you can't do that without
        depositing, and with
        <a href="https://pocketoption.com/smart/u5Wf6vpsXFCdX6" class="blue"
          >Pocket Option</a
        >
        , this is not an issue at all, as you've got many deposit options, such
        as major credit cards (Visa or MasterCard) and e-wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made a deposit the very same day using my old Visa card, which I used
        while I still worked at the shop. I decided to invest a small amount
        first, and this is a great advantage of
        <a href="https://pocketoption.com/smart/u5Wf6vpsXFCdX6" class="blue"
          >Pocket Option</a
        >
        , as you can start trading with just <span class="bold">$50</span>!
        Well, this is an amount even I could afford at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had hardly traded for an hour with my real cash when my account
        balance rose to $64. This was really incredible!!! My heart was about to
        burst, and I could hardly breathe! The only thing I could think of was:
        Wow! I MADE IT!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't sleep at all that night, and by the next day I already had $197
        on my account. Yes, that's right, a hundred and ninety-seven US
        dollars!!! <span class="bold">With just $50</span> I had deposited the
        day before. I couldn't believe it!!! I would have been stuck to my PC
        forever and ever, but I still needed to get some sleep, so I just headed
        to bed, while every step cost me effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I woke up at around 12PM, I logged into my account first thing.
        $197 were still there. <span class="bold">Not a dream, then!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the whole next day, I was completely stuck to my PC, and at midnight
        my account balance was at $773!!! I think I will remember this number
        forever, as this was my first serious success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look, $773-$197 makes $576, this is how much I earned in 12 hours. I had
        not earned such an amount in less than a day before!
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, before going to bed, I made a withdrawal request to cash out
        <span class="bold">₦220,061</span> on my Visa card. Before I fell asleep
        I was still wondering whether this all was real...
      </p>
      <p>
        I woke up in the morning when I got a text on my phone. This was my bank
        informing me that the <span class="bold">₦220,061</span> was credited
        into my account. <span class="bold">₦220,061</span>!!! Just arrived on
        my card!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        The day before, after making a mobile payment and an
        <a href="https://pocketoption.com/smart/u5Wf6vpsXFCdX6" class="blue"
          >Pocket Option</a
        >
        deposit, there had been less than <span class="bold">₦3,400</span> left.
        And then – <span class="bold">₦220,061</span>...It worked!!!
      </p>
      <p>This was a great day, the greatest of all in the last few years.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">Next week, I earned more than ₦1,667,134</span>, in
        two months, ₦6,668,536 more, in other two months, around ₦16,671,342,
        and then I could finally afford a brand new Porsche Panamera at
        ₦29,341,562!!! The car of my dreams, the dreams that had been almost
        forgotten...
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I had to take out a ₦13,337,079 loan on the car, considering cars
        are incredibly expensive in Nigeria, but with my earnings this was quite
        manageable. I was able to repay the loan shortly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look, here I am with my Porsche Panamera. Right on the day I bought it.

      <p>
        Now, while typing this post, I'm just trying to remember it all over
        again... How did I make it? And the answer is quite simple: I just
        believed in myself! First, I found an opportunity, and then I believed I
        could make money just like that guy on the web page. And that's it!
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">So, you need to believe</span> you'll be able to make
        it, too. This is very important, as you won't achieve anything without
        it. Never ever! If you don't believe in yourself, you'll start thinking
        all the best moments in your life are already gone. And this will be the
        case, if you keep thinking that way...
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are in despair and do not trust anything or anybody, you won't be
        able to spot your life changing opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to look for such an opportunity everywhere, in every event that
        happens around you, in every person you meet, in every story you read on
        the net... Just everywhere! Always try to use these opportunities, they
        are totally yours!
        <span class="bold">And then you'll finally make it!!!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason, I had always believed I will be be able to buy the car
        of my dreams. And I did buy it! I didn't save up, just bought it, as I
        had enough money to pay it. I've got an income source that will never be
        exhausted; quite the reverse: it brings more and more money every single
        minute! And yes, I no longer have to report to any boss or work long
        hours without even a chance to sit down, as it was before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold"
          >I make more money in a single day than I used to make in a month.
        </span>
        And I feel incredibly free!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Was that actually a miracle? Could be. But still,
        <span class="bold">it happened</span> , so it was real. I just read an
        article, believed in myself and made a decision. This is how I made it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh well, enough memories for now, as I'm already going quite
        off-topic...
      </p>
      <h2>So what do you need to do to start earning money?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, open an account with a broker by
          <a href="https://pocketoption.com/smart/u5Wf6vpsXFCdX6" class="blue"
            >clicking here</a
          >
          (you’ll need to enter your name, email address, phone number,
          password, choose the account currency and tick to show your agreement;
          click Register).
        </li>
        <li>
          Step-by-step you’ll be shown 7 tips describing what’s displayed on
          your account. Look through all the material by pressing «NEXT STEP»
          after every description.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Now for the interesting part! A strategy for making a profit!</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have an account with a broker, you need a 100%-profitable
        strategy. It’s recommended to start with the “up-down” strategy – it’s
        so simple, anyone can understand it and use it!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, you need to pick a currency pair: EUR / USD works well here.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get ready for your first trade: set a time of 1 minute and an amount
          of $1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now start trading. You have to forecast whether the exchange rate will
          go <span class="bold green">UP</span> or
          <span class="bold red-2">DOWN</span> within a minute after you opened
          the trade.
        </li>
        <span class="text"
          >With this strategy, you can make any forecast when you start. It
          doesn’t matter whether you choose UP or DOWN.</span
        >
        <li>
          Let’s say you pick <span class="bold green">UP</span>. Remember that
          it doesn’t matter what you pick. The strategy works 100% in any case.
        </li>
        <li>
          If in reality the chart goes up, as you predicted, you’ll get
          <span class="bold">$1.92</span> back in your account (instead of your
          initial one dollar!). Now you have to make your next trade, but this
          time you should choose the opposite value:
          <span class="bold red-2">DOWN</span> (the amount and time don't
          change; keep them at $1 and 1 minute).
        </li>
        <li>
          So let’s say the chart goes the other way and your trade isn’t
          successful. That means you need to raise the next trade to $3 and
          change the direction of the chart again (i.e. If your last choice was
          <span class="bold red-2">DOWN</span>, now you have to choose
          <span class="bold green">UP</span> );
        </li>
        <li>
          The chart once again doesn’t go the way you wanted, and you lose this
          trade too. This is nothing to worry about (remember, with this
          strategy you always make back your losses!). In order to recoup your
          losses and make a profit now, you have to increase the trade to
          <span class="bold">$8</span>
          (don't change the time of the trade). Then choose
          <span class="bold red-2">DOWN</span> (as we chose UP the last time).
        </li>
        <li>
          Great! That time you chose the right direction and got
          <span class="bold">$15.36</span> (you made up for your losses and
          earned more money!). Now go back to trading at
          <span class="bold">$1</span> and start over again. This time you have
          to choose <span class="bold green">UP</span> . That’s why it’s called
          the “up-down” strategy.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Remember!</h3>
      <p>
        Always change the direction (<span class="bold green">UP</span>,
        <span class="bold red-2">DOWN</span>,
        <span class="bold green">UP</span>,
        <span class="bold red-2">DOWN</span>), regardless of whether your bet is
        successful or not. Your first trade should always be
        <span class="bold">$1</span>. If you lose, increase the amount to
        <span class="bold">$3</span>. If you lose again, change it to
        <span class="bold">$8</span>. If it happens again, raise it to
        <span class="bold">$18</span> (personally, I’ve never had to do this
        despite the fact that I trade every day) As soon as a trade is
        successful, go back to the original amount of
        <span class="bold">$1</span> and start over again.

              But note that not all cards are suitable for payments on trading
              platforms. If your card was not accepted, then the easiest way to
              withdraw your funds fast would be an e-wallet.

              Jude why on Earth did you go all in? $100 in one trade,
              seriously??? Don't invest more than 2%, just as Emeka Orji says.
              So, you needed to invest 2% of $100, which is $2. No more than
              that! If you've got $50 on your account, then, all the more, don't
              invest more than $1. The most reliable strategy is funding your
              account with a minimum deposit, $50, and invest $1 per trade. I
              read this article and comments the day before and decided to try
              it myself. Deposit $50, and well, it didn't work for me either...
              I was shocked and thought this had been another form of scam....
              However, I tried once again, this time with $50, and yeah, got
              $100 in a couple of hours. I'm not a gambler, so I went on trading
              yesterday, and hit it again. Now my balance is $339:) Not so cool
              as Ekuwa says, but still not bad at all!

              Even if you follow the trend exactly, you will have some losing
              trades, that's fine. You can't be always a winner, no trader in
              the whole world can boast of that! You can have losing hours or
              even days, and you will have losses, as well as profits. Just
              follow a simple rule: don't invest more than 2% of your balance.
              So, if you've got $50 on your account, don't invest more that $1.
              The most difficult thing in trading is emotional control, not
              predicting. Remember: you'll have opportunities tomorrow, and next
              week, and next year.

              I deposited $500 yesterday using my credit card (interest-free for
              30 days). At 7PM, I placed my first trade with $30 investment
              amount. At 10 PM, my account balance was $1,130. So I paid the
              $500 loan back and got $630 profit in just 3 hours. Just fancy
              that! Thanks so much, Ekuwa!

              Just wanna tell you $400 or $500 a day is not the maximum. I've
              been trading on the platform for as little as 6 months, and I
              still earn $800 per day or even more! I trade more than 10 hours a
